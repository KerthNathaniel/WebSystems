        <h1>MANGROVES PLANTING</h1>
        <p>Mangrove planting plays a crucial role in protecting coastal ecosystems. Mangroves, which are salt-tolerant trees found along coastlines, 
            act as natural barriers against storms and coastal erosion. Their dense roots stabilize shorelines, reducing the impact of waves and 
            preventing soil from being washed away. <br><br>

            In addition to protecting the environment, mangroves serve as habitats for a wide range of marine life, including fish, crabs, and birds. 
            These ecosystems also provide resources for local communities, such as wood and fish. Moreover, mangroves are highly effective at absorbing 
            carbon dioxide, making them a valuable asset in the fight against climate change. <br><br>
            
            Mangrove reforestation efforts involve planting saplings in areas where mangroves have been depleted, often due to deforestation or 
            development. These projects not only restore biodiversity but also help mitigate the effects of climate change and protect communities 
            from natural disasters. <br><br>
            
            By participating in mangrove planting, individuals contribute to the conservation of ecosystems, support local livelihoods, and promote 
            a sustainable future.</p>
