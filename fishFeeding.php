        <h1>FISH FEEDING</h1>
        <p>Fish feeding is a key aspect of maintaining healthy fish populations in both aquaculture and natural ecosystems. Providing the right type 
            and amount of food ensures that fish grow properly, reproduce efficiently, and remain disease-free. In aquaculture, balanced diets rich 
            in nutrients like proteins, vitamins, and minerals are essential for the fish's growth and overall health. <br><br>
            
            Overfeeding, however, can lead to water pollution. Uneaten food sinks to the bottom and decays, releasing harmful substances such as 
            ammonia, which can damage the aquatic environment and harm fish populations. On the other hand, underfeeding can stunt fish growth and 
            make them more susceptible to diseases. <br><br>
            
            In natural environments, responsible fish feeding, often done by fish farmers or in controlled ecosystems, helps support local 
            biodiversity. It is also important to match the diet to the species of fish, as different types have specific nutritional needs. <br><br>
            
            Proper fish feeding practices not only promote healthy fish but also contribute to cleaner water systems and sustainable fish farming.</p>
